DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. It emphasizes automation, collaboration, monitoring, and integration across all phases of software delivery â€” from code commit to production deployment.
